# Newsletter Scraper

This script looks through the downloaded PDF version of the Stony Brook College of Arts and Science newsletter, and
pulls out all the data that is bolded for storage in the newsletter spreadsheet.

## Instructions

1. Copy the file path of your downloaded PDF version of the newsletter you want to scan.
2. Click on the scraper executable.
3. The program will display `exit;` before running. Please be patient as it may take some to start up.
4. Paste in the newsletter file path when prompted.
5. Once completed, the program will return the bolded text from the PDF, which can be used to fill out the newsletter content spreadsheet.

Hope this is helpful :)
